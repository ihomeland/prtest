= Vert.x EventBus Bridge Client

Vert.x EventBus Client is a Java client allowing applications to interact with a Vert.x EventBus bridge
via either TCP or WebSocket transport. After connection, it allows:

* Sending messages to an address of the EventBus.
* Sending messages to an address of the EventBus and expect a reply.
* Publishing messages to an address of the EventBus.
* Creating a consumer and register it against an address.
* Unregistering a consumer from its address.

Under the hood, the packets sent to server follow the protocol defined in link:https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-tcp-eventbus-bridge/java/[Vert.x EventBus TCP bridge].

NOTE: This client does not rely on Vert.x and requires a Java 6 runtime, making it embeddable in Android applications.

== Using Vert.x Event Bus Client

To use this project, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

== Creating the Vert.x EventBus Client

There are 2 ways to create a Vert.x EventBus client, depending on what type of the bridge to interact with:

=== Create a TCP event bus bridge client

```
{@link examples.ClientExamples#exampleTCPCreate}
```

This example can be used to create a client to connect to a link:https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-tcp-eventbus-bridge/java/[Vert.x EventBus TCP bridge].

With default options, the client will connect to `localhost:7000` via plain TCP. It is also possible to configure the client
to connect to different host and port with TLS/SSL enabled for security TCP connections.

=== Create a WebSocket SockJS bridge client

```
{@link examples.ClientExamples#exampleWebSocketCreate}
```
This example can be used to create a client to connect to a link:https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_sockjs_event_bus_bridge[SockJS EventBus Bridge] using WebSocket.

With default options, the client will connect to `http://localhost/eventbus/websocket` using WebSocket. It is also possible
to connect to different host and port with TLS/SSL enabled for security HTTP connections. `options.setWebSocketPath("/eventbus/message")`
can be used to specify the WebSocket path corresponding to the one specified in the SockJS bridge.

== Communicate with the EventBus Bridge

No matter what type of the bridge it connects to, after connection, the client can be used to communicate with the bridge in the following ways:

NOTE: Any of the following method leads to connect automatically if no connection established yet.

=== Sending messages to an address of the EventBus

Messages can be sent to an address of the EventBus.

```
{@link examples.ClientExamples#example01}
```

=== Sending messages to an address of the EventBus and expect a reply

Messages can be sent to an address of the EventBus with an expected reply handler specified.

```
{@link examples.ClientExamples#example02}
```

=== Publishing messages to an address of the EventBus

Messages can be published to an address of the EventBus.

```
{@link examples.ClientExamples#example03}
```

=== Creating a consumer and register it against an address

You can create a consumer and register it on an address of the EventBus, it will be called
when there are any messages sent to that address.

```
{@link examples.ClientExamples#example04}
```

=== Unregistering a consumer from its address

You can unregister the consumer from its address when it does not need to listen on that anymore.

```
{@link examples.ClientExamples#example05}
```

== Closing the Client

You can close the client to release the connection to the bridge server.

```
{@link examples.ClientExamples#example06}
```

== JSON format encoding

The client and the bridge exchange messages in a custom JSON format encoded using an implementation of `JsonCodec`. The
client ships two `JsonCodec` implementations.

When creating a new `EventBusClient` instance without specifying `JsonCodec`, it tries to load `GsonCodec` first, if Gson
is not in the classpath, it tries to load `JacksonCodec`, if FasterXML Jackson data-bind is not in classpath either,
it fails to create the client instance.

You can specify a custom instance of `JsonCodec` when creating a new `EventBusClient` instance as well.

=== GsonCodec

The `JsonCodec` implementation based on link:https://github.com/google/gson[Google Gson project].
The dependency of `com.google.code.gson:gson` is optional, you need to add this dependency explicitly to use this implementation.

=== JacksonCodec

The `JsonCodec` implementation based on link:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind[FasterXML Jackson databind].
The dependency of `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` is optional, you need to add this dependency explicitly to use this implementation.


== EventBus Client Options

There are 2 main options in Vert.x EventBus Client.

=== EventBusClientOptions

The `EventBusClientOptions` is used to configure the EventBusClient during creation, it has the following properties:

* `host`: String, the host of the bridge to connect to, defaults to `localhost`.
* `port`: int, the port of the bridge to connect to, defaults to `-1`, which means `7000` for TCP bridge and `80` for WebSocket SockJS bridge.
* `webSocketPath`: String, the path connect the WebSocket client to, defaults to `/eventbus/websocket`. It is used only by the WebSocket EventBus Client.
* `maxWebSocketFrameSize`: int, the maximum WebSocket frame size, defaults to `65536`. It is used only by the WebSocket EventBus Client.
* `ssl`: boolean, indicates if SSL is enabled, defaults to `false`, which means SSL is not enabled.
* `trustStorePath`: String, the path of the trust store. It is used only when `ssl` is true.
* `trustStorePassword`: String, the password of the trust store. It is used only when `ssl` is true.
* `trustStoreType`: String, the trust store type, one of `jks`, `pfx`, `pem`, defaults to `jks`. It is used only when `ssl` is true.
* `verifyHost`: boolean, if hostname verification (for SSL/TLS) is enabled, defaults to `true`. It is used only when `ssl` is true.
* `trustAll`: boolean, if all servers (SSL/TLS) should be trusted, defaults to `false`. It is used only when `ssl` is true.
* `pingInterval`: int, ping interval, in milliseconds, defaults to `5000` ms.
* `autoReconnectInterval`: int, the length of the pause between auto reconnect tries, in milliseconds, defaults to `3000` ms.
* `maxAutoReconnectTries`: int, the maximum number of auto reconnect tries, defaults to `0`, which means no limit.
* `connectTimeout`: int, the connect timeout, in milliseconds, defaults to `60000` ms.
* `idleTimeout`: int, the idle timeout, in milliseconds, defaults to `0` which means no timeout.
* `autoReconnect`: boolean, whether auto reconnects is enabled, even if the client does not try to send a message, defaults to `true`.
* `proxyHost`: String, the proxy host.
* `proxyPort`: int, the proxy port.
* `proxyUsername`: String, the proxy username if the proxy requires authentication.
* `proxyPassword`: String, the proxy password if the proxy requires authentication.
* `proxyType`: ProxyType, one of `ProxyType.HTTP`, `ProxyType.SOCKS4`, `ProxyType.SOCKS5`.

=== DeliveryOptions

`DeliveryOptions` is used when sending messages to the bridge, it has following properties:

* `timeout`: long, the send timeout, in milliseconds, defaults to `30 * 1000` ms. If there is no response received within the timeout the handler will be called with a failure.
* `headers`: Map, the headers sent to the bridge EventBus.
